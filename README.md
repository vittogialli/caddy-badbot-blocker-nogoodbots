# Caddy Bad Bot Blocker - no good bots fork

## Differences from original
- Removed "good bots" whitelisting - google, alexa, etc get blocked like the rest of non-human traffic
- Added an AbuseIPDB blocklist, courtesy of [borestad](https://github.com/borestad/blocklist-abuseipdb)
- Added Firehol Botscout and Abusers ip blocklists, courtesy of [borestad](https://github.com/borestad/firehol-mirror)
- Auto refreshes lists with the correct Caddyfile option specified below

### AI disclaimer
LLMs were used in this fork as i do not know how to program in Go. If that matters to you, use the original repo and modify it yourself. Personally, a couple calls to an LLM to make code that will block a thousand more (a day) is fine with me.


## Caddyfile config for this fork:

```caddy
# Example Caddyfile


(badbot_block) {
        @badbot {
                badbotblocker {
                        refresh_interval 24h
                }
        }
        handle @badbot {
                abort
        }
}

localhost {
	import badbot_block

	respond "Hello, world!"
}
```

# Original description below 

## Caddy Bad Bot Blocker

This is a module for the Caddy v2 web server that acts as an HTTP request matcher. Its purpose is to identify and block malicious bots, aggressive crawlers, and spam referrers, based on the excellent blocklists provided by the [mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker) project.

The module checks the IP address, User-Agent, and Referer of each incoming request and compares them against the blocklists.

## Features

-   Blocks requests based on the client's IP address.
-   Blocks requests based on the User-Agent.
-   Blocks requests based on the Referer.
-   Uses blocklists from the `nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker` project by default.
-   Allows excluding specific IP addresses or User-Agents from being blocked.
-   Allows customizing the URLs from which to download the lists.
-   Provides structured and customizable logging for blocked requests.
-   Easy to setup with fail2ban

## Installation

To use this module, you need to build a custom version of Caddy that includes it. This process is made simple by the `xcaddy` tool.

1.  Ensure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.25 or later).
2.  Install `xcaddy`:
    ```bash
    go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
    ```
3.  Build Caddy with the `caddy-badbot-blocker` module:
    ```bash
    xcaddy build --with github.com/AlphaByte02/caddy-badbot-blocker
    ```
4.  This command will create a `caddy` executable in the current directory. Replace your existing Caddy binary with this new file, or use it directly to run the server.

## Configuration

Configuration is done directly in your `Caddyfile`. Here is a complete and commented example showing how to use the module.

```caddy
# Example Caddyfile

# Optional global options block
{
    # Log for requests blocked by the module.
    # They will be logged in JSON format to the specified file.
    log badbotblocker {
        # Only log messages generated by our module
        include http.matchers.badbotblocker
        output file /var/log/caddy/bad_bots.log
    }
}

your-domain.com {
    # --- Bad Bot Blocker Integration ---

    # You can put this route on snippet ad reuse it for other domain
    route {
        @banned {
            badbotblocker {
                # (Optional) Exclude specific User-Agents from being blocked
                # exclude_user_agents "MyCustomAgent/1.0" "AnotherAgent"

                # (Optional) Exclude specific IP addresses from being blocked
                # exclude_ips "192.168.1.100"

                # (Optional) Exclude specific Referer from being blocked
                # exclude_referer "CustomReferer"

                # (Optional) Override the default blocklist URLs
                # user_agent_list_url "https://mysite.com/user-agents.txt"
                # ip_list_url "https://mysite.com/ips.txt"
                # referer_list_url "https://mysite.com/referers.txt"
                # trusted_ip_list_url "https://mysite.com/trusted-ips.txt"
            }
        }

        # Abort requests that match @banned and skip logging them
        # in the main access log.
        route @banned {
            log_skip
            abort
        }
    }

    # --- Logging Configuration ---

    # Configure the standard access log.
    # Blocked bots will be skipped because of 'log_skip' above.
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/access.log
    }

    # --- Your other site directives ---

    # For example, a reverse proxy or a file server
    respond "Hello, world!"
}
```

### Configuration Explained

1.  **`@banned` Matcher**: A named matcher `@banned` is defined. Our `badbotblocker` module analyzes the request. If it matches an entry in the blocklists, the matcher returns `true`.
2.  **`route @banned`**: This block defines what to do with a request that matches `@banned`.
    -   `log_skip`: This directive tells Caddy to not write this request to the standard access log, keeping it clean.
    -   `abort`: This immediately terminates the connection, blocking the bot.
3.  **Logging**:
    -   The `log badbotblocker` block in the global options creates a separate log file (`bad_bots.log`) that will contain **only** the detailed information (in JSON format) about the requests we have blocked.
    -   The standard `log` block within the site configures the `access.log`. Blocked requests won't appear here because of the `log_skip` directive used previously.
4.  **Example**:
    -   You can find an example of Caddyfile under example folder

## Credits

This module would not be possible without the fantastic work of the blocklists provided and maintained by the **[mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker)** project.
